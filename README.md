# JS Assignment Declarative

---

In this assignment students are tasked with converting an imperative implementation of calculateTotal to a declarative implementation. A skeleton is provided which includes the original imperative solution as well as the functions to be implemented for use in the final declarative solution. Students should implement all of the commented out functions which have `TODO` in place of their function bodies. Students should also complete all the type signatures in comments marked `TODO` above implemented functions.
